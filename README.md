Source code for the amortized population Gibbs (APG) samplers in the paper Amortized Population Gibbs Samplers with Neural Sufficient Statstics [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01382). The implementation was built on [ProbTorch](https://github.com/probtorch/probtorch), a deep generative modeling library which extends [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
